###### Final checklist
- glass door questions
- behavioural. typical questions, notebook of original interview, one or two facebook products I know really well
- Project I know very well in depth
- Questions for interviewer 
- read through and review to make sure we didnt miss anything






What content you should know 

## Spend time brushing up on your CS fundamentals – algorithms, data structures, etc. You will need to demonstrate practical mastery of the following:


- Arrays and lists 
- binary trees 
- hash tables 
- stacks and queues
- basic graph representations 

- understanding of data structure fundamentals like pointers (as if you weren't using an object-oriented language).
- Make sure you have both time and space complexity down for the data structures you end up using in your solutions 

- become fluent in Big O Notation; knowing O(n), O(1), etc is important.

###### You will need to write these out and explain them to another person on a white board so practice this!

- search through data structures 
- understand how to implement iterators
- understand binary search
- and how hashes work
- have your sorts down 
 - merge
 - quick
 - bucket sorts
- know how to traverse a graph (either BFS or DFS)
- understand how to do recursions. 

###### These will definitely be useful for solving our interview questions as well.

- trie
- heap
- set
- red-black trees
- randomized quicksort
- dynamic programming
- heap sort
- radix sort
- spanning tree
- minimum cuts as well

## (Behavioral) Typical questions asked. And example answers

- ##### Imagine it is your first day here at Facebook. What do you want to work on? 
  - I'd likely be on a team that has been developing an app or feature. I would love to learn the end-to-end process of how it worked, examine who was going to use it, examine previous design decisions and the direction that we would like to move. Basically I would want to work on learning about everything in place already so I could move as fast as I could.
- ##### What features would you improve on? 
  - A Map for check ins that cna be shared across friends to see common places we have both been.
- ##### Why are you interested in Facebook? 
  - Several reasons. 1. Most importantly I want to move quick, learn as much as I can and create things w/ an impact, right now I feel like i'm playing catchup with tools and technologies when I want to leading it. It seems like FB has this exact community.
  - 2. The collab, I want to work alongside people who will push themselves and learn from each other. A group always striving to be the best.
  - 3. Openness, FB constantly talks about how all parts of the company should be open to all employees. If I want to learn about the VR product than I should be able to read their APIs. Right now I can't even configure my own deploy plan.
  - 4. The leadership, Sheryl Sandberg seems amazing. Heard her talk a few times and learned about Zuckerburgs Q/A. I'd be happy to go in the direction they want, and if I don't I can likely voice my opinion.
- ##### Know about our technical environment, projects, challenges, etc. and be excited! 
  - Huge eco system of people working together to create new things. Products that scale out massively, move quickly, and ship constantly. Also researching lots of new tech. everywhere.
- ##### What are the most interesting projects you have worked on and how might they be relevant to the Facebook environment? 
  - Always collecting data. Figuring out how to analyze it, store it, never worry about storage.
- ##### What are some of the biggest professional challenges you have faced, and how you have overcome them?
  - Not really on the coding side, but trying to convince my team to work harder. Scenario - ppl. moved slow, didnt follow procedure, etc. Solution - Have us experiment with new tech. and code reviews, tried to show the impact and how much they could learn, figured out what people liked to work on and put them on it. Most importantly I tried to get their customer excited by presenting our work differently. Result - Happy workers, more output, one of the top teams, more knowledge sharing.



Practice coding as many problems as possible and time yourself. Here is a FB site to practice coding: https://codelab.interviewbit.com/registration. There are also many other sites to practice coding (Careercup.com, Topcoder.com and Hackerrank.com are good places to go for practice problems also).

[One Month to Prepare Schedule](https://www.quora.com/Google-Interview-Questions/How-should-I-prepare-for-my-Google-interview-if-I-have-1-month-left)

1. (days 1-2)The main sections above. Learn about the process. Get a good foundation of what a prepared candidate is.
2. (days 3-5) Benchmark. Take a few questions from each chapter, find my weak points, time myself. Prioritize what I do bad on.
3. (days 3-5) Make a study list. Check things off that I need to complete.
4. (days 6-18) Practice algorithms and data structures daily. Write out a random algorithm or datastructure, its Big-O
5. (days 6-18) Tackle as many programming questions as possible. Cracking the coding interview - once completed look at Facebook programming questions, then  other resources.

Cheat Sheets:

[Github Fork - descriptions, explanations, what we should know, etc.](https://github.com/JumpingRock/InterviewPrep/blob/master/CheatSheet.md)

[Big-O](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)


[Tutorial point data structures and algos](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/index.htm)

| Data Structure        | Implement from scratch           | run times  | status |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
| Linked List      | implement Node(), appendToTail(), deleteNode(Object data) | Search O(n) Do not sort | Can implement. Need adv. practice |
| Binary Tree      |  | Insert Worst/Avg. O(log(n)), find any worst O(log(n)), create worst O(nlog(n)) | Only know basic knowledge |
| Inorder | left subtree, root, right subtree | bottom up, then top down. |  |
| Preorder | left subtree, right subtree, root. Bottom up. | |  |
| Post Order | root, left subtree, right subtree. Start with root, recurse through left, recurse through right. top down.  | |  |
| Hash Table | key % hashTableSize | O(1) lookup, insert, delete | Just need to review diff. types of hashMaps, maps, tables, etc. |
| Stack | pop() push() peek(), use Obeject data for node data | | Tackle problems and review. Adv. usage?  |
| Queue | enqueue(), dequeue(), size(), peek() | 0(1) | Tackle problems and review. Adv. usage?  |
| Graphs | | | Know nothing |
| Trie | Map multiple values to each node (array or hashmap). To insert add nodes missing the char, to remove work to the bottom then move up making sure you do not delete paths to other words (track with is word? Track number of childern? etc. | O(1) - deepest is longest word | Moderate knowledge. Seems easy. Practice in real problems |
| Heap | Use on top of array. Max heap means node is greater than all children. | Insert Avg. (1), insert worst O(log(n)), find any worst O(n), find max/min worst O(1), create worst O(n) | know nothing |
| Vector | Basic use, just like array list. Generics? | Like a List, but synchronized. Also grows dynamically, you can set capacity for it to grow, check capacitiy, and set an entire new size | Basic knowledge. Need to use |
| Iterator | Implement using interface | | Basic. Need to implement. |

| Sort/Search Algo        | Implement from scratch           | Best | Avg. | Worst | Space |  
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| Binary search      | Not yet. Cut in half search left / right. Cut in half...repeat | O(1) | O(log(n)) | O(log(n)) | O(1) |
| Bubble sort      | Two for loops. In the inner loop swap if a[i] > a[i+1] | O(n) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(1) |
| Merge sort      | sort(){ left = sort(left); right = sort(right); return merge(left, right);} | O(n log(n)) | O(n log(n)) | O(n log(n)) | O(n) |
| Quick sort      | Pick partition (middle of low-high). Put all elements lower than partition to the left, all elements higher to the right. perform quick sort on low-partition-1, partition+1-high. | O(n log(n)) | O(n log(n)) | O(n^2) | O(log(n)) |
| Bucket sort      | Like using hash functions. To choose which bucket to put value in: ((value-minvalue) / bucketSize). Sort the buckets individually, then place back into original array. | O(n + k) | O(n + k) | O(n^2) | O(n) |
| BFS      | | b | a | w | |
| DFS      | | b | a | w | |

| Other        | Proficient           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Recursion      | basic. divide and conquer can be bottom up or top down. | |
| Probability      | | |
| Bit Manipulation      | | |
| Java Questions      | | |
| O-O Design      | | |
| Threads, locks, mutex, semaphore      | | |
| DP      | | |
| NP-Complete      | | |
